Landing Page project.

Within this project i was tasked with creating a landpage using HTML and CSS (Flexbox). I had an idea of what the landing page had to look like including the colours and fonts. However the programming was up to me I could go about it anyway i wanted to.

I started by using Flexbox for the elements that needed to be in rows and organised correctly. This included the Navbar, footer and information parts. From there I then created different borders for where images could go and designed it accordinaly.
